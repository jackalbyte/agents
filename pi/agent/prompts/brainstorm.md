# Brainstorm

Turn ideas into designs through collaborative dialogue before implementation.

## Process

### Phase 1: Understand the Idea
Check project context first, then ask questions one at a time:

1. **Gather context** - check files, docs, recent commits relevant to the idea
2. **Ask questions one at a time** - prefer multiple choice when possible
3. **Focus on**: purpose, constraints, success criteria, integration points

Try to collect questions related to the same topic in one message.

### Phase 2: Explore Approaches
Once the problem is understood:

1. **Propose 2-3 different approaches** with trade-offs
2. **Lead with recommended option** and explain reasoning
3. **Present conversationally** - not a formal document yet

### Phase 3: Present Design
After approach is selected:

1. **Break design into sections** of 200-300 words each
2. **Ask after each section** whether it looks right
3. **Cover**: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
4. **Be ready to backtrack** if something doesn't make sense

Do not present entire design at once. Incremental validation catches misunderstandings early.

## Key Principles
- **One question at a time** - do not overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - remove unnecessary features from all designs, keep scope minimal
- **Explore alternatives** - always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - present design in sections, validate each
- **Be flexible** - go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense
- **Lead with recommendation** - have an opinion, explain why, but let user decide
- **Duplication vs abstraction** - when code repeats, ask user: prefer duplication (simpler, no coupling) or abstraction (DRY but adds complexity)? explain trade-offs before deciding
